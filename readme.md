# PALM Meeting Tool

> A simple framework to plan effective meetings that make decisions instead of wasting time.

Part of the [Corporate Clarity](https://corporateclarity.xyz) toolkit for fighting organizational dysfunction.

## What is PALM?

PALM is a straightforward framework designed to transform meetings from drawn-out discussion forums into focused decision engines. It addresses the four critical elements that most meetings lack:

- **Purpose**: What do you want the meeting to **achieve**? (Not "discuss")
- **Agenda**: What **decisions** need to be made to achieve the purpose? (Not "topics")
- **Limit**: What's the **maximum time** you'll allow?
- **Minimum**: What's the **smallest number of people** we need there?
