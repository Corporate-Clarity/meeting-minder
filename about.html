                    <h2>What is the PALM Meeting Technique?</h2>
                    <p>PALM is a straightforward framework designed to transform meetings from drawn-out discussion forums into focused decision engines. It addresses the four critical elements that most meetings lack:</p>

                            <h3>Purpose</h3>
                        </div>
                        <div class="palm-description">
                            <p>What do you want the meeting to <strong>achieve</strong>? (Note: "achieve" not "discuss".)</p>
                            <p>Most meetings fail because they're framed around topics to discuss rather than outcomes to achieve. By defining a clear purpose focused on tangible results, you immediately shift the meeting's trajectory.</p>

                            <p>What <strong>decisions</strong> need to be made to achieve the purpose? (Note: "decisions", not "discussion topics".)</p>
                            <p>Traditional agendas list topics, which invite open-ended conversation without clear endpoints. By framing agenda items as decisions to be made, you create natural closure points and focus the conversation.</p>

                            <p>Meetings expand to fill the time allotted. By setting shorter time limits than you think necessary, you create productive pressure that eliminates unnecessary tangents and social loitering.</p>

                    <p>The PALM technique isn't just another corporate frameworkâ€”it's built on well-established research about human decision-making, cognitive load, and group dynamics:</p>

                            <p>"Work expands to fill the time available for its completion." This principle informs the 'Limit' component of PALM, recognizing that shorter timeboxes create focus.</p>

                            <p>Research shows that decision quality deteriorates after extended deliberation. PALM's focused approach preserves cognitive resources for the decisions that matter.</p>

                            <p>One of the greatest barriers to effective meetings is organizational silos. PALM helps address this by:</p>

                                <li>Reducing the "meeting culture" that often develops differently across silos</li>
                                <li>Establishing a common language for productive collaboration</li>
                                <li>Making the cost of cross-silo meetings explicit, encouraging better preparation</li>
                                <li>Providing quantifiable metrics that work in any department</li>

                            <p>A Fortune 500 technology company implemented PALM across their product development division (1,200 employees) and tracked the results over 6 months. They found:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>31% reduction in total meeting hours</li>
                                <li>47% increase in decisions made per meeting</li>
                                <li>22% improvement in employee satisfaction scores</li>
                                <li>Estimated $3.7M in productivity savings annually</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>The key to their success was integration with existing tools and systems, rather than treating PALM as a separate initiative.</p>
